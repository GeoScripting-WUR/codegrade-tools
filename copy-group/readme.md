# Copy group

This repository contains code to copy all relevant git projects from one instance of geoscripting to the next iteration.

Before this code works, the structure has to be copied. This can be done by exporting a group
and importing it again. The name has to be changed. This can be done using the 
gitlab web gui. To do this go to `Settings>General>Advanced>Export`. When creating 
a new repo there is an option to import from existing sources. See also [here](https://git.wur.nl/help/user/project/settings/import_export).
